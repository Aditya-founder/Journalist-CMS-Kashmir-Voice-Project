💸 Cost-Cutting Strategy
Render’s free tier sleeps your app after inactivity to save cost, causing 2-minute delays on cold starts.
To solve this:

🔁 A background ping function runs every 30 seconds from the backend, keeping the app active and live 24/7 without requiring constant user visits — effectively avoiding downtime while staying within the free Render limits.

Make sure you add your .env variables for MongoDB URI and other configs in the server/ folder.

🔒 Admin Access
